HELM is a package manager for Kubernetes, which is an open-source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

HELM provides a way to package and distribute applications as charts, which are collections of files that describe the resources needed to run an application in a Kubernetes environment. A chart can include templates for deployment manifests, services, and configmaps, among other things.

HELM makes it easier to manage the deployment and lifecycle of applications in a Kubernetes cluster by providing a convenient way to define, install, upgrade, and manage the configuration of applications. This helps to ensure consistency and reproducibility in the deployment process, and reduces the time and effort required to manage the deployment of applications in a Kubernetes environment.

In summary, HELM is a powerful tool that helps to streamline the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications in a Kubernetes environment.
